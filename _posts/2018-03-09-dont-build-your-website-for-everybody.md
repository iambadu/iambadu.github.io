In designing or building your website, you have to know exactly who your end user will be. As a rule of thumb is never a good practice to try build your website for everybody. Different users have different needs and different goals. A tech enthusiast shopping for a smartphone online will like different details highlighted compared to a car salesman who just want to buy a new phone.

Highlighting or giving the wrong details to the wrong audience wouldn’t work well for your website. Is better to always focus the content and the elements of the website to the users you mostly care about. Generally, due to their needs and goals, most users of your websites will have similar behaviors. Once you know what these behaviors are, you can easily design a user experience that is just right for them.

In design, the tools usually come second and the ideas and principles come first. Is worth the time to actually take time to write down the attributes of the visitors who will eventually use your website. Analyze what their goals are, what they value and what might cause them to leave or stop using your website. In UX design this kind of user sketches is called a persona. The content of the website you eventually build should then reflect the goals and values of the persona.

In going through the rest of the design, use the persona as a guide and ask yourself if the persona or user will eventually feel that the site was custom built for them? The good thing about this individual focus on a particular user is, the final product becomes a site that many people will enjoy using. It gives your website and extreme focus that helps it stand out compared trying to build for everybody on the web.

Most of the time, visitors come to your website through links from others sites or by being referred by search engines. Most visitors to your website do not know your direct URL. People mostly use the web to achieve a particular purpose, for some, it is to be entertained, find information or buy something. So whenever someone visits your website, they come with a particular goal in mind. The role of the Web Designer is to help the users to achieve these particular goals as soon as possible

Since most of your site visitors come from search engines and links, this means they’re not typically coming to your homepage but to a page somewhere on your site. It is very necessary that the page they first see let them know they are getting the right information they need. Each page needs to say exactly what it is about and give the visitors an understanding of how the information on the site or page is laid out.

You can do this, by making sure that your navigation is very descriptive, it should be about the items on the site or the tasks that people can perform. Each page should also show what the page is about using a descriptive heading and if possible, incorporate informative pictures and summary text. In doing this, you make sure your website helps users to quickly know what the page or website is about and also whether you have the information they want. This makes the users have a smooth web experience and makes their lives easier. This, therefore, makes them more willing to use your site in the future.
